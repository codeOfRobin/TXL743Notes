# Chitosan properties

Derivation of chitin(  certain substance (chitin) found in mushrooms did not dissolve in sulfuric acid.)
Also found in in crustaceans (such as crabs, lobsters, shellfish and shrimp), the indigestible outer skeleton of insects and the material from which the cell walls of the mycelial fungi are made.

Many factors present in the chitosan molecule or its environment can influence the antimicrobial properties, such as the molecular weight, DDA and the ionic strength and  **pH of the dissolving medium**.  

-  It has been proposed that interaction between positively charged chitosan molecules and negatively charged microbial cell membranes leads to the disruption of microbial membrane, and subsequently the leakage of proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents
- Chitosan interacts with the membrane of the cell to alter cell permeability

- Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with Gram-positive bacteria than with Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. As a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested, except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. Antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by pH, with higher activity at lower pH value.


One factor that limits the application of native chitosan is its non-solubility in neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. 
Studies have shown that all quaternary ammonium chitosan derivatives were highly water-soluble at acidic, basic and neutral pH
